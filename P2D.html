      <h3>
        Group 9
      </h3>
      <p>
        I chose group 9 because I really enjoy the personalization that went into this office.<br><br>

Walking into the office there is a private room for one that is stylistically simple. I enjoy the honeycomb bookcase and the books that are interactable on it. Having a more organic shape of a bookcase makes the space feel more realistic and alive. On the desk itself is a phone and small details like that truly begin to enhance the feeling of immersion. The phone itself plays music off of Spotify which was a nice touch. There are also small objects for employees to play with on the bookcase, such as a mini minion or an Angry Bird toy. I really enjoyed the unique sounds each toy created when interacted with as it corresponded to the character.<br><br>

Continuing thorugh the office iteslf is a pleasure as it seems packed with interesting objects. Everywhere you look there is minute details and you are compelled to interact and get closer. 
My favorite part of the scene is definitely the musical blocks. I thought this was something very unique. Picking up individual blocks produces different notes and allows the user to create their own melody. I think this was very fun to play with in VR and would be equally as fun to play with in the real world, something I would want in my dream office. <br><br>

The meeting room that is within the office is also very modern and sleek. I would love to have brainstorming sessions inside a room like this. Something else that I liked about this room was the light switch and the ability to adjust the strength of the light. Hearing sounds when pressing the buttons mimics almost a tactile sensation as a user lacks that with a VR headest but sound helps compensate.<br><br>

Overall, I think the strengths of this office is the attention to detail and the excellent use of sounds. Even smaller details such as the animated ceiling fan. It makes the room feel much more alive. Also things like being able to interact with the stereo and turn the music off.The space is packed with interesting objects but leaves room for the user to navigate it. <br><br>

      <h3>
        Group 1
      </h3>
      <p>
        I chose group 1 because I really enjoy the activities that are in the office and the detail paid to sounds.<br><br>

When you first enter this office, the first thing I noticed was the basketball hoop. I thought this was a fun addition to the space as it allowed the user to play almost a mini game of sorts. There is also an interactive coca cola machine which actually produced a drink when you click the button. I thought this was cool and the animation makes the space feel more alive. These were definitely objects I would want in my dream office. <br><br>

A huge part of this scene that helps it feel realistic is the sounds that are produced when throwing objects. An object will make an impact sound that is relative to how hard it was thrown. I really liked this functionality as it made the scene much more immersive and fun (for someone like me who likes to throw items all over the place :) ). <br><br>

Another one of the sounds I really appreciated in this scene was the classic Windows XP startup and shutdown sound. I thought it was really cool to incorporate that as it is a sound a lot of user would be familiar with, which in turn again amplifies the immersion. I thought it was also neat to add the ability to shut down each computer which again played its corresponding sounds. Furthermore, the small knick-knacks found on the desks are well proportioned such as the headphones, so when the user picks them up it doesnâ€™t feel strange. I think the added small Gus, which is a character from our Video game design, was a sweet little easter egg and it was an excellent idea to resize him to make him knick-knack size.<br><br>

Finally, another really unique added feature was what happens when the user approaches the cactus. We know it real life that is a bad idea but in VR we are tempted to try picking it up and giving it a good toss without the pain. Except when you touch the plant in this game you hear a scream of pain, immediately mimicking real life and making the scene more realistic.<br><br>

Overall, I think the sounds make this game very unique and help it feel much more immersive.
